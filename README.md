**Give it a URL. Get back a deployed, full-stack clone.**

An autonomous pipeline that inspects any SaaS product, builds a working clone with real cloud infrastructure, tests everything, and deploys it — no human in the loop.

## Proof It Works

We pointed Ralph-to-Ralph at [resend.com](https://resend.com) during Ralphthon Seoul 2026 and walked away:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Features built | **52** |
| Lines of code | **24,000+** |
| Unit tests passing | **388** |
| Dashboard pages | **10** |
| API endpoints | **16+** |
| Total time | **~4 hours** (fully autonomous) |
| Human intervention | **Zero** |

The clone sends real emails via AWS SES, verifies real domains, auto-configures DNS via Cloudflare, and deployed itself to AWS App Runner. It placed **2nd** at the hackathon.

## Why

Most AI coding demos produce toy apps — a single page with hardcoded data and no tests. We wanted to know: **can AI agents autonomously clone a real product, end-to-end, with real infrastructure?**

Ralph-to-Ralph is the answer. It doesn't scaffold a template or generate boilerplate. It browses the target product like a human would, writes a detailed PRD, implements every feature with TDD, stands up real cloud services, runs independent QA, and deploys. The entire pipeline runs unattended.

## How It Works

Ralph-to-Ralph is a three-phase autonomous pipeline managed by a watchdog orchestrator:

1. **Inspect** (Claude + [Ever CLI](https://foreverbrowsing.com)) — Browses the target product, extracts documentation, captures screenshots, and generates a detailed PRD with 50+ features
2. **Build** (Claude) — Implements each feature one-by-one with TDD, real cloud infrastructure (AWS SES, RDS Postgres, S3), and commits after every feature
3. **QA** (Codex + [Ever CLI](https://foreverbrowsing.com)) — An independent evaluator that tests every feature against the original product, finds bugs, fixes them, and verifies the results

The **watchdog orchestrator** ties it all together with auto-restart on failure, git commit + push after every iteration, and a build-QA-fix loop that runs up to 5 cycles until everything passes.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) | Runtime |
| [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Powers Inspect + Build phases |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Powers QA phase |
| [Ever CLI](https://foreverbrowsing.com) | Browser automation for inspection and E2E testing |
| [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) | Cloud infrastructure (configured via `aws configure`) |
| Docker | Deployment |

### Run It

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/jaeyunha/ralph-to-ralph.git
cd ralph-to-ralph

# Install
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS, Cloudflare, and other credentials

# Provision AWS infrastructure (RDS, SES, S3, ECR)
bash scripts/preflight.sh

# Go
./scripts/start.sh https://your-target-product.com
```

That's it. The system will inspect the target, build every feature with tests, QA everything independently, and deploy to AWS App Runner.

## What Gets Built

The loop produces a **fully functional, deployed product** — not a mockup.

| Capability | Implementation | When |
|------------|---------------|------|
| Full-stack web app | Next.js 16 + TypeScript | Always |
| REST API | Bearer token auth | Always |
| Database | RDS Postgres via Drizzle ORM | Always |
| Unit + E2E tests | Vitest + Playwright | Always |
| Deployment | Docker + AWS App Runner | Always |
| Email delivery | AWS SES | If the target sends emails |
| DNS management | Cloudflare API | If the target manages domains |
| File storage | AWS S3 | If the target handles uploads |
| TypeScript SDK | With React email support | If the target has an SDK |

### AI Agents

| Agent | Role | Phase |
|-------|------|-------|
| Claude | Inspect the target product and build the clone | 1, 2 |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Independent QA evaluation | 3 |
| [Ever CLI](https://foreverbrowsing.com) | Browser automation for inspection and E2E testing | 1, 3 |

## Customization

### Changing the target

```bash
./scripts/start.sh https://any-saas-product.com
```

### Cloud credentials

Edit `.env` to configure:
- **AWS** — SES, RDS, S3, App Runner (required)
- **Cloudflare** — Auto-configuring DNS records (optional)

### Modifying agent behavior

The system is controlled by prompt files you can edit:

| File | Controls |
|------|----------|
| `inspect-prompt.md` | How the inspect agent analyzes the target |
| `build-prompt.md` | How the build agent implements features |
| `qa-prompt.md` | How the QA agent tests features |
| `pre-setup.md` | Pre-configured setup context (read by all agents) |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does a run cost in API credits?</strong></summary>

A full run (inspect + build + QA) against a complex product like Resend costs roughly $30–60 in combined Claude and Codex API usage, depending on feature count and how many QA fix cycles are needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work on non-SaaS products?</strong></summary>

It's optimized for SaaS products with dashboards, APIs, and documentation. Static sites or native apps won't produce great results. The inspect phase needs browsable UI and ideally public docs to generate a meaningful PRD.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if a phase fails?</strong></summary>

The watchdog orchestrator automatically restarts failed phases (up to 5 times for inspect, 10 for build). It also commits progress after every iteration, so you never lose work. If it exhausts retries, it stops and you can inspect the logs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I skip phases?</strong></summary>

Yes. If you already have a `prd.json`, you can run the build and QA phases directly by calling `./build-ralph.sh` and `./qa-ralph.sh` individually. Each phase is a standalone script.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this without AWS?</strong></summary>

AWS is required for the full pipeline (RDS for database, SES for email, S3 for storage, App Runner for deployment). You could modify the prompts and `preflight.sh` to target a different cloud provider, but that's not supported out of the box.
</details>
